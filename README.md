# Machine Learning React

This project is a machine learning models management web app.

It has been created using React, Redux and RTK Query.

In terms of styling, it uses Bootstrap, more specifically the 'reactstrap' library.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

It will run the app in development mode.

The project uses the advantages of Webpack 5, so Hot Module Replacement is enabled.
### `npm run mock`
This will start a json-server mock API. 

Remember to run this while running the application so you can login.
